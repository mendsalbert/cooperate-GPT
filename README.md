## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- MongoDB (v4 or later)
- Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cooperate-gpt.git
cd cooperate-gpt  `

2. Install backend dependencies: `cd backend
npm install  `

3. Install frontend dependencies: `cd ../app
npm install  `

## Configuration

1. Backend (.env): `PORT=1999
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cooperate_gpt
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE=30
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_EMAIL=your_smtp_email
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@cooperategpt.com
FROM_NAME=Cooperate GPT  `

2. Frontend (.env.local): `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:1999
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key  `

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend
npm run dev  `

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server: `cd app
npm run dev  `

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

- User authentication (sign up, login, password reset)
- AI model management (create, list, and use models)
- Content generation using AI models
- Chat history and management
- File upload and processing
- Dashboard for analytics and usage statistics

## API Documentation

The backend API is documented using Swagger. Access the documentation at:

http://localhost:1999/api-docs

## Project Structure

```
## Backend Setup

Follow these steps to set up the backend of Cooperate GPT:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```

cd backend

```

2. Install dependencies:
```

npm install

```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
```

PORT=1999
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/cooperate_gpt
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRE=30d
JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE=30
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_EMAIL=your_smtp_email
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@cooperategpt.com
FROM_NAME=Cooperate GPT

4. Set up MongoDB:
- Install MongoDB on your system if you haven't already
- Start the MongoDB service
- The application will create the necessary collections automatically on first run

5. Set up the project structure:
- Ensure the following directories exist in the `backend` folder:
  ```
  backend/
  ├── controllers/
  ├── middleware/
  ├── models/
  ├── routes/
  ├── utils/
  └── uploads/
  ```
- If any are missing, create them manually

6. Configure the server:
- Open `server.js` and ensure all necessary middleware and routes are properly set up
- Check that the MongoDB connection is correctly configured

7. Set up API routes:
- In the `routes` directory, create or modify route files for different API endpoints (e.g., `authRoutes.js`, `queryRoutes.js`, etc.)
- Ensure all routes are properly imported and used in `server.js`

8. Implement controllers:
- In the `controllers` directory, create or modify controller files to handle the business logic for each route
- Make sure error handling is implemented using the `asyncHandler` middleware and `ErrorResponse` utility

9. Set up models:
- In the `models` directory, define Mongoose schemas for your data models (e.g., `User.js`, `AIModel.js`, `Query.js`)

10. Configure middleware:
 - In the `middleware` directory, set up any custom middleware (e.g., authentication middleware, error handling middleware)

11. Implement utility functions:
 - In the `utils` directory, create any helper functions or utilities needed across the application

12. Set up Swagger documentation:
 - Ensure `swagger.js` is properly configured to generate API documentation
 - Add Swagger annotations to your routes and models

13. Test the backend:
 - Start the server by running:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
 - Use a tool like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints
 - Ensure all routes are working as expected and proper error handling is in place

14. Security considerations:
 - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
 - Set up CORS properly to restrict access to your API
 - Ensure all sensitive data is properly encrypted or hashed

15. Prepare for deployment:
 - Set up a production-ready process manager like PM2
 - Configure your environment variables for production
 - Set up logging for production environment

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional backend for Cooperate GPT. Remember to keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control.
